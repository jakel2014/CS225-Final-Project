### Comments
The new proposal changes the dataset and alters the visualization algorithm. The main issue I see with this proposal is that you have mentioned that you are using a weighted graph, but you have not specified how the edge weights will be obtained. Normally this would require another resubmission, but it seems like your group already has an idea of how to weight the different flight routes, so I am willing to approve the current proposal. 

Since you are working with latitude and longitude values for this dataset, I would recommend taking a look at Haversine distance for this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula
