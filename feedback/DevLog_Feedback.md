Your group spent time working on refining the proposal, which looks good for the most part (I have posted my comments in the regrade feedback file). Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Week of 4/4 - 4/10


### Grade
Sufficient

### Comments:
It looks like your group has made considerable progress on the project, great work so far! I like that your group has also been meeting consistently, and has detailed updates for each member. It looks like you've already been doing this, but don't forget to include test cases for your algorithms and graph data structure. Test cases are one of the factors we consider in the mid-project check-in meeting (and for the final submission), so be sure to write them as you make more progress on the project.
