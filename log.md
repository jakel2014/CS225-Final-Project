## 3/31 MEETING NOTES
We had an in-depth discussion about our former proposal, taking careful note of instructions from Adit. We decided that our current plan was not feasible for us to complete under the requirements of the project, so we decided to make a new proposal and project idea.
We decided to change our dataset to the OpenFlights data set, and take some of the suggested algoithms to make ourselves. We found the map to be very intriguing. For this week, the majority of our time was spent reformulating our project proposal and making sure we had a complete understanding of the task that we have created for ourselves. 
Next week, we hope to maintain close to our original project plan and have data acquisition completed. If everything goes according to plan, we should still be on track for the mid-project check in!

## 4/6 MEETING NOTES
During the 3/31 meeting, we decided we wanted to meet twice this week. For our first meeting this week, we started laying the foundation for our code. Lucian began working on preprocessing for our dataset, while Satvik, Eli, and Jake began creating pseudocode for Dijkstra's algotithm, our DFS, and miscellaneous helper functions. Satvik did considerable work on his own working out the Dijkstra's algorithm: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F-bTSmK1FuKoeYkar5mkL3HNOel7NOVkksZlTMJL81s/edit?usp=sharing . We also began discussing our implementation of our test cases and our makefile. Lastly, we created pseudocode for a helper function that calculates distance between two airports using haversine formula. 

## 4/8 MEETING NOTES
During the 4/8 meeting, we met in person at the ECEB. In our second meeting for this week, we planned to finish preprocessing and get started with Dijkstra's and/or DFS. Preprocessing is now functional, although we are unsure if it is perfect as of right now. We also coded the calcDistance function using haversine formula. Satvik explained his proposal for our Dijkstra's implementation to the group. We got a good amount of work done and we think we are on track to have Dijkstra's and/or DFS completed for our mid-project meeting. Jake has been in charge of managing DFS development, while Satvik has been in charge of Dijkstra's. Our pre-processed data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FydU0N817mAsYE5ryJ9I2Xd7UIoC87R3/view?usp=sharing . At this current time, we are planning on meeting twice again next week so we can quickly finish our functions to be ready for the mid-project meeting on Friday. 

## 4/14 MEETING NOTES
Earlier this week, we had a quick meeting on monday to plan our our tasks to complete this week and prepare for the mid project presentation. Satvik worked on Dijkstra's Algorithm and test cases for it, Lucian worked on the makefile, and Eli and Jake worked on the main file to parse the CSV files with our data in it. During our meeting today, we found a more compatible CSV parsing library for us, and uploaded it to our repository. We are 90% finished with our preprocessing. Satvik was able to complete Dijkstra's along with several test cases for his algorithm. Lucian was able to get the makefile working, hence why we were able to run Satvik's test cases. Eli and Jake worked on preprocessing in the main file using rapidcsv, and we believe that all of our Routes data has been sucessfully converted into our weighted edges. Once we have our trimmed airports-preprocessed.csv file completed, all of our preprocessing will be complpeted. Everyone worked on general debugging of all of our current code. Jake also did some work towards our DFS algorithm, although we think we will revisit it after the mid project check-in. As of right now, we think we are making great pace on our project and we are exited to begin working on our visual output.

## 4/22 MEETING NOTES
This week, we had a short meeting before our mid-project check in. We had a light discussion about our plan for the check in and how we were going to divide up the rest of the work that we have planned out. This was a busy week for our team, with exams for PHYS 213, ECE 210, and CS 225 taking up much of our group's time. Next week we plan to resume our regularly scheduled meetings, and work on some of the tips that were given to us in our check-in meeting. We hope to have all of our preprocessing completed and begin to make additional test cases for both our DFS and Djikstra's this week.

During our check-in with Adit, he recommended implementing test cases for our graph data structure and possibly our data parsing code, just like we've been doing for Dijkstra's algorithm and DFS.

## 4/25 MEETING NOTES
This week, we started with a meeting on monday to create a plan for our project moving forward. Lucian was set to work on finishing up data processing, while everyone else focused on preparing our code to begin working on our visual output. We plan to move our code that used rapidcsv into its own class so that we can run it independantly in our test cases. Eli was assigned to making DataParser.h, Jake continued working on DFS test cases, and Satvik began planning out our visual output as well as adding additional functionality to our weighted graph class.
