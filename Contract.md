# Team Contract

## Communication
### Team Meetings
Team Meetings will be held Thursdays 7PM. We will make an effort to meet in person, but in the case of an external conflict, the meeting will be held through discord call. If Thruday at 7PM does not work for any given week, meet at another time. If a meeting is not held, then everyone should send an update as to what they did and what they hoped to do. In each team meeting, a member will update the DEVELOPMENT LOG to record meeting notes. Meeting notes should consist of any major design changes, role assignments, and progress updates. Lucian will be the designated note taker. 

### Assistance
The team can contact each other using Disord, email, and messages. Expected reply time is about 48 hours unless any external conflicts take place. 

### Respect
All major design desicions will decided with a simple majority vote. While unanimous majority is preffered, it will not be required. By signing this contract, every team member should follow what the whole team is doing so that everyone is on the same page even if they may not agree with the rest of the team. To ensure that everyone gets a say in each team meeting and throughout the project, everyone will state their opinion and reasoning before any vote. 

## Collaboration
### Work Distribution 
Each team member will be responsible for providing their weekly goals for the project and updating the team on what they accomplished the week before. We can split up major objectives in the project to two people who can decide amongst themselves to get to the objective.  

### Time Commitment
Each member should have clear goal in mind on what they want to implement and the amount of work it should take. If a certain task has unforseen complications, the team should work together to distribute the work and ensure the total work is balanced among the whole group. Each team member should be expected to put at most 6 hours per week and at least 2 hours per week on the project.

If a team member is not performing to the expectations of the rest of the group, then that team member will be told politley to start putting in more work multiple times. If the issue persists very far, the rest of the team can agree to take it up with the project TA.

### Conflict Resolution
All conflicts within the team will be decided by a Super Smash Bros match, Final Destination, 3 stock no items. The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong (Might makes right). Or majority vote.
